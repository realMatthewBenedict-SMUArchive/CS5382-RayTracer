This image code originates from chapter 14 of the book, and the checkerboard texture mapping was taken from chapter 4 of the second book.

In addition to changing the color parameters for the sky and grid, and adding a second layer of spheres, I wish to draw attention to the large dielectric sphere near the center at (3, 1, 0).

Unlike the other spheres, this sphere has an extra fudge factor in the hit function, which makes it appear to be trapped inside another sphere with warped reflections from behind.

Since the large number of reflective surfaces leads to excessive runtime for this scene at this size, I chose to set the recursive depth and sampling count at 10 and 20, respectively, to provide fairly decent quality, without taking hours to run.

Resolution: 1024 × 576 pixels
Recursive depth: 10
Sampling count: 20
Last frame: 683.11 seconds (11 minutes, 23.11 seconds)
Wall clock: 975.68 seconds (16 minutes, 15.68 seconds)
Camera location: (13, 5, 3) looking at (0, 0, 0), 20 degree FOV
